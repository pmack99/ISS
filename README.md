The International Space Station Tracker

ABOUT THIS PROJECT
My name is Preston Mack. I am currently enrolled in the University of Central Florida's Coding Bootcamp. The first group project required us to develop an app that utilized multiple APIs and used Firebase for storage. The "ISS Tracker" was the result. For this version, I rewrote much of the code, stripping away extraneous features (like Firebase) and I changed the API used for the ISS passovers. Thanks to my wonderful class partners Sarah Sefcik, Jennifer Gibson and Christine Deer.

ABOUT THIS SITE
I utilized the "wheretheiss.at API" for the ISS location. Leaflet was integrated with the Mapbox API to generate the realtime map. This application utilizes a Mapquest API for the reverse geocode. Once the coordinates are obtained, that data is passed into the "N2YO.COM REST API" to parse the ISS pass information. Finally, the NASA Image Archive API was used to obtain the photos and captions. The Bootstrap framework was used for the layout.
